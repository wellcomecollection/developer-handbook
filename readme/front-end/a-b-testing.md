# A/B testing

### Steps to create an A/B test

A/B tests can be created using special variants of the [toggles](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-LumfFcEMKx4gYXKAZTQ/s/DPDDj27NI2F2kPukWrC1/~/changes/75/readme/front-end/toggles-feature-flags).



* Add a test object to [`toggler.ts`](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/wellcomecollection.org/blob/main/cache/edge_lambdas/src/toggler.ts) and add an equivalent test object with the same `id` to [`toggles.ts`](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/wellcomecollection.org/blob/main/toggles/webapp/toggles.ts)  â€“ this second object is important because it allows us to determine [what should be sent to GA](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/wellcomecollection.org/blob/main/common/services/app/analytics-scripts/google-analytics.tsx)

```
{
  id: 'someToggleId',
  title: 'New subject tags on works pages',
  range: [0, SOME_PERCENTAGE],
  when: request => {
    return !!request.uri.match(/SOME_REGEX/);
  },
}
```

* Update and upload the lambda deployment package:

```
docker compose build edge_lambdas
AWS_PROFILE=experience-developer docker compose run edge_lambdas yarn deploy
```

* deploy the lambda:

```
terraform plan -out=terraform.plan
terraform apply terraform.plan
```

* Make a note of the `edge_lambda_request_version` and `edge_lambda_response_version` numbers in the terminal resulting from the terraform command
* Check `www-stage` and verify the test cookie (`toggle_someToggleId`) is set
* Check the data is being sent to GA (either `someToggleId` or `!someToggleId`). You should initially be able to see the toggles dataLayer variable being set (`DLV - Toggles`) in GTM, then this data should get sent to GA as a custom dimension (note you might not be able to see this until the next day)
* Update [`locals.tf`](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/wellcomecollection.org/blob/main/cache/locals.tf) with values from previous terraform and re-run the terraform steps above to get the changes in to production
* Use the toggle to conditionally serve different UI in the same way as you would for [feature flags](../../developer-handbook/front-end/toggles-feature-flags.md)
