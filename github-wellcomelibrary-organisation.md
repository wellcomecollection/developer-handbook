# GitHub: wellcomelibrary organisation

[https://github.com/wellcomelibrary/](https://github.com/wellcomelibrary/)

This GitHub organisation isn’t actually being used for anything important, and it’s on the free plan so it won’t show up in billing.

&#x20;It contains a couple of things:



* A small README that points you to the wellcomecollection GitHub page
* Redirects for a couple of repos that moved into the wellcometrust organisation, e.g. [https://github.com/wellcometrust/player](https://github.com/wellcometrust/player) and [https://github.com/wellcometrust/examples](https://github.com/wellcometrust/examples) (these URLs are linked to from a couple of old blog posts about IIIF),
* A very old pattern library written in PHP, which hasn’t been touched in seven years. I’m not even sure if this is WL-specific or if it’s part of big Wellcome; either way it’s stale and could likely be deleted.
