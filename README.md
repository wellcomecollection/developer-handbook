# Developer handbook

This is a guide to how software development works at Wellcome Collection. It includes:

* our broad principles and approach
* how we work, and why we work that way
* runbooks and procedures for common operations

It generally doesn’t cover the specifics of individual products or services – those are better left to documentation that lives alongside the code for those services.
