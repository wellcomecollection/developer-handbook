# React: FC vs FunctionComponent

In our React codebases, we use FunctionComponent instead of FC. This choice was made mostly arbitrarily; the deciding factor was that FunctionComponent is slightly easier to search for than FC.

We should continue to be consistent about this unless we have a good reason to change.
