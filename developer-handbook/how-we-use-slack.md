# How we use Slack

### Our Slack channels <a href="#our-slack-channels" id="our-slack-channels"></a>

We have a lot of Slack channels!If you're a new starter, these are the most useful ones to join on your first day:

* **#wc-digital-general** – general team chat
* **#wc-digital-experience/ #wc-digital-platform** – general chat for the two sub-teams
* **#wc-collections-and-digital** – general chat for the entire department
* **#wc-platform-feedback** – where people in other teams can give us feedback on the platform and the website, e.g. ideas or bug reports

Some other important channels are:

* **#wc-incident-response** – when something goes wrong, this is where we gather to discuss how to fix it (see also: [When something goes bang](https://app.gitbook.com/s/DPDDj27NI2F2kPukWrC1/incident-management/incident-response-process) in the Developer handbook). This channel is pretty quiet most of the time.
* **#wc-platform-alerts** – this is where our automated alerts are sent, e.g. when somebody gets an error on the website. This channel can be quite noisy, especially when there's an outage.

We also create **project/topic-specific channels**, which are for people working on a particular thing to discuss it without creating too much noise in other, more general channels. e.g. the **#wc-ga4-transition** channel was created to discuss the move from Universal Analytics to GA4.There are lots of other Slack channels in Wellcome, which aren’t Platform team/Wellcome Collection-specific – this is just a summary of the ones we use most often.

### Using threads for long discussions 🧵 <a href="#using-threads-for-long-discussions" id="using-threads-for-long-discussions"></a>

We try to use threads for long discussions, to keep the channels easy to skim – people can decide whether or not to dip into a particular thread.Try to keep threads to a single topic – if a thread evolves into a completely different topic, it can be more helpful to create a new thread and link it from the old one. That way, anybody who's interested in the new topic but not not the old topic can see the new discussion, and jump into the new thread without scrolling through the old one.The spool of thread emoji (🧵) is a common convention on the first message to say _“I’m about to start a thread, more to follow”_ but it's not required, just a bit of fun.

### Product/technical discussions in public <a href="#product-technical-discussions-in-public" id="product-technical-discussions-in-public"></a>

In general, we try to have product/technical discussions in public channels, for example:

* “I’ve deployed a new feature to the website. Can I get some feedback please?”
* “This page is broken for me: \[link, screenshot] What’s up?”
* “Here’s an interesting tool we could use in an upcoming piece of work: \[link]. Has anybody used this tool before?”

We like to do this in public channels when possible, because it gives everyone more visibility into what’s happening, and opportunities to learn from other people’s work.This includes “debugging out loud”, where somebody will talk through a problem they’re having in a thread. (A textual form of [rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber\_duck\_debugging).) Sometimes this includes asking other people for help; other times just stating the problem is enough to solve it. This can be a learning opportunity for other people – seeing how you solve problems, and they’ll know how to fix it if they face the same problem later.
